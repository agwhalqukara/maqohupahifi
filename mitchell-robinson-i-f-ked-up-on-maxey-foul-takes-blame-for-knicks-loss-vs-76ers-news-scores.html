He also contributed nine assists and five rebounds.</p><p>Sixers superstar center Joel Embiid contributed 19 points and eight rebounds, but he was clearly laboring at times due to a lingering knee injury. That required Maxey to put the team on his back in some big moments.</p><p>The Knicks were hoping to end the series at home, and the loss wasn't for a lack of trying on the part of All-Star guard Jalen Brunson.</p><p>New York's late-game collapse spoiled a 40-point effort from Brunson, who was just as spectacular as Maxey for much of the contest.</p><p>The win gave the Sixers new life after being on the brink of elimination, but the Knicks will have another chance to close out the series in Game 6, which will be played Thursday in Philadelphia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW6AeH6MpqCtm5iaua150aiZoqajpLtutYyfZGajlZl6tryMqKVmpZGtsrp5xaispWWklrimv4ybo5qllWKzsL6MpKWim5uoeq270qxkr6tdbIOmvtI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
