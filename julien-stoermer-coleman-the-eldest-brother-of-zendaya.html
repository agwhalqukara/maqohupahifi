He has a built-up body that looks good enough in his thirties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Young-Julien-Stoermer-Coleman-with-his-sisters-jpg.webp><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Julien Stoermer Coleman Height and Weight&nbsp;</h3><p>Julien Coleman weighs 70-75 kilograms, is five feet eight inches tall, and his body measurements are 42, 40, and 40.</p><p>EZ is in his late thirties. He is of <a href=#>American-African descent</a> with black skin color, eyes, hair color, and a well-built body.</p><p>In addition, he has a beautiful smile. Sometimes, he wears glasses, and sometimes, he doesn’t. Here’s the picture of him in a tuxedo with his beautiful daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Parents&nbsp;</h2><p>His parents, his father, and his stepmother were teachers back in Oakland. Still, at present, his stepmother, Claire Stoermer, owns a jewelry company, and his father, <a href=#>Kazembe Ajamu Coleman</a>, manages the professional life of his sister Zendaya. There isn’t much information about his real mother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Zendaya-with-her-dad-and-mom.jpg><p>Julien Stoermer Coleman belongs to an American-African family. However, his father belongs to native Africa, whereas his mother is also from African lineage, but his stepmother <a href=#>Claire Stoermer</a> is of Irish-German-Scottish-English descent.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Siblings&nbsp;</h2><p>Julien has four sisters named Katianna, Anabella, Kaylee, and Zendaya (half-sister), while he has one brother named Austin.&nbsp;</p><p>Katianna Stoermer Coleman is the eldest sister of EZ. She is a married woman. She has been a great sister and a mother as well.</p><p>Anabella Stoermer Coleman is <a href=#>the second eldest daughter</a> in the Stoermer Coleman family. Julien has a great bond with his sister Anabella, who is also married and blessed with beautiful children.&nbsp;</p><p>Austin Stoermer Coleman is the brother of Julien. There needs to be more information about Austin. Austin stands 6ft tall and weighs around 60-65 kilograms. He has a beautiful wife and children whom he loves the most.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Julien-Stoermer-Coleman-with-his-family-jpg.webp><p><a href=#>Kaylee Stoermer Coleman</a> is the youngest of all. She is the little sister of Julien and probably the loveliest, as younger ones are always the “apple of the eye” of the family. Kaylee has been seen on the red carpet with Zendaya.&nbsp;</p><p>His siblings have a very private life resembling his, but his half-sister Zendaya, born on the 1st of September, 1996 in Oakland, California, US, is <a href=#>an American actress and singer</a>. Zendaya is the most prominent icon of the industry, and she has earned a tremendous amount of love and praise all around the globe.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wife and Kids&nbsp;</h2><p>Julien Coleman is married to his wife, Sonja Coleman, and he has a daughter and a son.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Julien-Coleman-with-his-father-Kazembe-wife-and-kids-jpg.webp><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career</h2><p>Julien Stoermer Coleman is quite a private person, so there aren’t any useful details about his profession. According to some sources, it has been mentioned that EZ works as an editor in movies. However, it is not yet confirmed news.</p><p>About playing in movies, it needs to be clearly mentioned. He doesn’t seem like an actor or interested in doing movies. People may think that because of his half-sister <a href=#>Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman</a>, who is an established singer and actor in Hollywood.</p><p>Still, according to the source, EZ is financially established with a significant net worth. We have gathered as many details as possible from different sources, but they’re still insufficient. We are unsure about Julien’s career; he might not have played in any movies.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Julien-Stoermer-Coleman-with-his-daughter-jpg.webp><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Julien Stoermer Coleman Instagram&nbsp;</h2><p>His nickname is EZ, and an Instagram account named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EZ Coleman</a> belongs to him. He has a great life with his beloved ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Julien Stoermer Coleman Net Worth</h2><p>As of 2023, Julien Stoermer Coleman has a net worth between USD 600-800k.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Julien Coleman Now</h2><p>Being a brother of the international pop artist <a href=#>Zendaya Stoermer Coleman</a>, people have raised his name on different platforms. Still, due to his private lifestyle, he rarely appears in the media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zendaya-with-her-dad-and-siblings-jpg.webp><p>Moreover, Julien is <a href=#>a family man</a>, a loving brother, a son, a wise father, and a husband.
