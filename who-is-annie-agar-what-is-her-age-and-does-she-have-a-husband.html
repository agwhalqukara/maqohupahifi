She was born on the 12th of April 1996 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America. Her birth sign is Aries and she follows the Christianity religion. She is an American national with a White ethnic background. Annie is the eldest in a family of three children; she has a brother named Johnny and a sister Gracy, a social media influencer.</p><p>From what is seen, Annie Agar got her passion for sports from her father. While her mother is a homemaker, her father Jeff Agar played as a minor league pitcher in the Detroit Tigers farm system for several years. Annie also gets her love from her brother named Johnny. Johnny was born with cerebral palsy and she has a very close bond with him.</p><p>Johnny is also a sports enthusiast and Annie likes to spend a lot of time with him discussing sports. She showers her brother with much love which helps him to function in his daily life. Annie generally has a close relationship with her family and is fond of sharing photos with them on her social media platforms.</p><h2><strong>She Studied Sports Broadcasting at Grand Valley State University</strong></h2><p>Annie Agar initially got into sports as a way to bond with her dad as well as her brother but she later found that she genuinely loved it. She, therefore, tailored her career toward that direction and worked hard to bring her dreams to fruition.</p><p>Annie Agar completed her elementary and high school education at a local private school in her neighborhood where she took part in several sports activities. After high school, she proceeded to Grand Valley State University, and in 2014, she earned a bachelor’s degree in the field of Pre Law/ Sports Broadcasting. This was the beginning of her sports reporting career.</p><h2><b>She is now a Broadcast and Online Sports Journalist</b></h2><p>At 26, Annie Agar has successfully created her identity in her career. After getting her degree in sports broadcasting, she started working at a local news station where she spent two years. That was the time the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Consequently, she lost her job because everything that she covered especially sports was no longer happening.</p><p>She was 24 then and moved back in with her parent, spending much of her time thinking about what to do next with her life. Then, on Mother’s Day 2020, she came up with an idea to do a Big Ten Zoom meeting and also show it in a video. So she shot the video on Mother’s Day and just within a day, her phone was already blowing up as the video went so viral.</p><p>Annie definitely knows that people were missing out on the laughter in sports and used the opportunity to bring them out of the dark cloud of Covid, and, today, she has made a job out of it and become a leading sports content creator. She partnered with some companies with whom she shares her content and they together make money off it.</p><p>Annie said that she shoots her videos on TikTok because it is effortless for her to edit on the platform. In addition to creating sports content, Annie Agar works as a reporter at WOOD TV8 and as an Administrative Assistant at Davidson Plyforms Inc. Moreso, She is a full-time correspondent at Bally Sports, a position that makes the bedrock of the fame and huge fan following she enjoys today.</p><p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Annie’s professional sports reporting career started in November 2017 after she joined Grand Rapids Drive. She worked there for two years and in 2019 moved to West Michigan Whitecaps where she worked as an on-field host for five months. Her career has seen her interview several top celebrities like Kirk Cousins and Peyton Manning.</p><p>What’s more, Annie Agar is well-known as a TikTok star.

She also has a self-titled YouTube channel which has gathered over 3.5k subscribers, where she mostly posts her NFL-related content. Annie is also known for frequently sharing reels on her Instagram account.</p><p>Annie endorses some notable brands which she promotes on her social media pages.
