According to <i>Fox 35 News</i>, Ryan disclosed to the media that her security camera recorded what seemed like a baby dinosaur crossing her yard.</p>"Any animal we can come up with that would be 'walking' at 3:40am in the morning, wouldn't walk this way. Maybe I have watched 'Jurassic Park' too many times, but I see a raptor or other small dinosaur!" Ryan told Fox 35 News.<p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?
