He was scheduled to take an official visit to Arkansas the weekend of June 23.</p><p>"Our hearts are broken for the family," Alston said. "Dion was such a great young man. He had a smile that warmed your heart when you had a chance to be around him."</p><p>A 6'3", 250-pound defensive lineman, Stutts was a 3-star recruit and ranked as the 18th-best player in the state of Tennessee and No. 65 player at his position, per <a href=# rel=noopener>247Sports' composite list</a>. He officially made his commitment to the Razorbacks on March 11 over offers from Louisville, Ole Miss, Texas A&M and South Carolina, among others.</p><p>As a junior for MUS this past season, Stutts recorded 30 total tackles and 13 tackles for loss to establish himself as one of the best defensive linemen in the Memphis area. He also competed on the school's wrestling team.</p><p>"We're going to miss that smile, miss that wonderful personality and we're just praying for his family right now," Alston said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ25%2Fd4SMnaCopl2owbbA06xkmqqblru0rdJmnainpJeurbiMq5ycqqWewW6wyJ6qZpmkYn55ecinZJqooJa%2FprrTZpitrl2WsKS1w56lrQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
