Adams: I'm &amp;quot;Loving All Of It&amp;quot;</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Pretty little engagement! <strong><a href=#>Troian Bellisario</a> </strong>and <strong>Patrick J. Adams </strong>have kept quiet about their impending nuptials since the Suits actor popped the question, but all of that changed on Tuesday, June 10. Bellisario gushed about the couple's next step to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> while attending the Max Mara Women in Film Cocktails event at the Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood.</p><p>It's "not any different. It's bizarre. It's not any different," the 28-year-old told<strong> Us</strong>. "I'm still loving all of it."</p><p><a href=#><strong>Us </strong>confirmed</a> back in February that the Pretty Little Liars actress and Adams, 32, were headed to the altar. "They got engaged in early January and have been keeping it a secret," a source told <strong>Us </strong>of the couple, who first met in 2009. "She's <a href=#>been hiding her ring</a> in the press."</p><p>The future spouses both have busy schedules, but have managed to make their relationship work. "We live in different cities so it's Skyping," Bellisario told <strong>Us</strong> of their typical date nights. Bellisario's ABC Family series PLL, recently renewed for a sixth and seventh season, is filmed in L.A., while Adams resides in Toronto as his USA Network lawyer drama is shot there.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"A lot of air miles…You make it work!" Bellisario added to<strong> Us</strong> back in December. "Might be in different cities—with a different cast or a different story line—but we are both experiencing a very unique opportunity in both of our careers at similar times."</p><p>When the couple does reunite, however, they enjoy going on double dates with a fellow TV star—Scandal's <strong>Katie Lowes</strong>.</p><p>"We are really good friends," Bellisario said of Lowes, who's married to actor<strong> Adam Shapiro</strong>. "We just threw a dinner party at our house last night and Katie was there so we were raging Apples to Apples until the morning and then I had to go to work," she continued of their board game fun. "And we run into each other at parties, which is the best!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKurp5mWu26uxKWjoquRp7awecSnnpqflZl6tbuMqZitqpmYuG62jJqbmqWjYrauecuoraKml2KurbiMqJ1moaRif3F9k2pobw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
