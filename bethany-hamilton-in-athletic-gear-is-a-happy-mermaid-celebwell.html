Hamilton, 34, who famously lost her arm in a shark attack when she was 13, is seen surfing in a variety of outfits, including black shorts and a long-sleeved shirt. "More happy mermaiding this year! ü§ôüèºüèÑüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôåüèºüßúüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I shared two new years goals on my blog this week. Comment "purpose" and I'll message you to get them to your email! ü§ó," she captioned the post. Here's how Hamilton stays fit, healthy, and full of energy.</span></p><p><span>Hamilton upped her calorie allowance from 2,200 to 4,000 after realizing she needed much more than she was getting. "Since I burn so many calories each day ‚Äì surfing, working out, breast-feeding full-time, traveling and raising children ‚Äì I realized that I wasn't eating enough," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she wrote on a website post</span></a><span>. "I was undernourished! I needed more protein and a lot more carbs. I also was low in many minerals, so that was affecting me negatively. The foods I eat more of now are better supporting an overall balance of the various proteins, carbs and minerals that I need on a daily basis."</span></p><p><span>Hamilton's workouts revolve around surfing (of course) and high-intensity exercises. "I usually surf one to five hours a day in two sessions," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she told </span><i><span>Fit Bump</span></i></a><span>. "Surfing is my go-to as far as exercise, but I love working out and getting a sweat on. I often get distracted outdoors, but in a gym I can focus. I usually do a Tabata-style workout. I like high-intensity with various lunges and squats and some explosive versions. I'll also incorporate the TRX, Bosu, step-ups and a ball, sometimes some light dumbbells, too. I love swimming, deep-sand beach jogs and sprints, playing tennis, spinning, running stairs. I love a variety of workouts so I don't get bored!"</span></p><p><span>Hamilton loves animal-based nose-to-tail protein. "I focus on organic and locally grown foods and I just kind of try and balance it all out so I'm getting a variety of nutrients that will benefit my body," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she wrote on a website post</span></a><span>. "I eat a lot of animal foods (from grass-fed and grass-finished, happily raised animals!) such as beef, bone broth, liver and organ meats. Haha, liver and organ meats ‚Äì I know ew, right? But, people have regularly consumed them for ages and the health benefits are incredible! I enjoy dairy and try to get it raw when possible. I get raw milk from my brother, who is a dairy farmer, so I know where my milk is coming from which is super cool! I've even met his cows! Some of my other staples are lots of potatoes, cooked veggies, fruit, squashes, fruit juices, and sprouted and sourdough grains. These foods have drastically helped my health improve."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/shutterstock_662455447.jpg><p><span>Hamilton starts her day with a protein smoothie. "My typical morning shake consists of a protein, like Designer Protein's Essential 10 Performance Vanilla Plant Based Protein and Recovery Supplement, with unsweetened almond milk, a half banana or handful of blueberries (or any fruit I have around!), and two big handfuls of spinach," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she told </span><i><span>The Inertia</span></i></a><span>. "Often I'll add ground flax seeds and a healthy fat like MCT Coconut Oil, coconut cream or flax oil for extra health benefits. I'll also add collagen powder and sunflower lecithin for their health benefits."</span></p><p><span>Hamilton is happiest at home with her family. "I love home, Hawaii," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she told Thrive Market</span></a><span>. "I'm secretly a homebody; I love sleeping in my own bed, making my own food, being active and surfing, and being close to my family. We do travel a ton, but I guess it makes home that much sweeter."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKOx06GYp7Fdna6utcutpqdlmaN6osDHpZytoZNitKat0WagrGWRYrWivM%2ByZKadoqKuqrCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
