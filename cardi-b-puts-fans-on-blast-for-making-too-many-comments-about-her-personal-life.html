It all ramped up even more when she tied the knot with Offset who later reportedly had an affair with another woman.</p><p>Amid the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">news of her split with Offset,</a> Cardi has been dealing with a slew of new comments about her life, and she’s not here for it. The star recently took to her account to suggest that it was all getting to be a bit too much.</p><p>According to Hot New Hip Hop, Cardi B was on her Twitter account to call out some of her fans who told her she shouldn’t be working with certain individuals. The rapper released a few audio recordings, one of which features the star telling her fans that she doesn’t like their tone.</p><p>Also, the rapper urged her fans to worry about their own business and focus on their work. As most know, 2020 has been a hard time for many people from all backgrounds, but especially for performing artists who are struggling to make ends meet on account of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CGA9GDYgUXO/</p><p>As most know, the debate between Mike Pence, the Vice President, and Kamala Harris, the vice-presidential candidate for the Democratic party, was controversial for a number of reasons.
