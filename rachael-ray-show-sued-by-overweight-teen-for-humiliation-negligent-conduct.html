She spoke on the show about how she had endured bullying because of her weight, and hoped that Ray could help turn her life around.</p><p>Two years later, however, the teen is alleging in a lawsuit filed Tuesday, April 16, that Ray and her colleagues were "grossly negligent, careless, reckless, wanton, and outrageous" in their conduct.</p><p>Among other accusations, she claims that the trainer yelled and screamed at her during their sessions "in a manner that caused Plaintiff to feel anxious, demeaned and threatened."</p><p>Pagliarolo highlights one incident in particular, in which her trainer, <strong>Eric Viskovicz</strong>, reportedly made her work out on a Stairmaster and "continually increased the speed" even though she begged him to stop. When she eventually fell off the machine, she was again "yelled and screamed" at.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The suit also details one instance in which Pagliarolo was "coerced" into taking a hike, and her "extraordinarily weak and painful" legs gave way, causing her to "fall in a manner causing serious injury to her legs."</p><p>Pagliarolo is seeking an unspecified amount in "punitive damages in an amount appropriate to punish and make an example of Defendants and each of them." She is including The Rachael Ray Show, CBS, and Viskovicz in her lawsuit.</p><p>"We haven't received this purported lawsuit but if it does materialize we will defend ourselves against it vigorously and fully expect to prevail," a rep for the show&nbsp;told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmam5iWsq150ZqwZquYpMRuv9Sem2aaqWK8t7HRsJyin5iperWxxKdkn6eiYrW2uciloJqsmaS7brrEoKOin5WjwW6vzqebrpukYn9xfZJqbm0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
