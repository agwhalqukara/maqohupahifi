His length and ability to run make him one of the top cornerbacks in this year's class. He has the frame to continue to add weight, and with time and maturity, he should improve his play strength. Wiggins has the ability to be a starter in the NFL, but he will need to continue to improve his technique early on in his career."<p>Wiggins, who committed to Clemson as a <a href=# rel=noopener>four-star prospect</a>, spent all three seasons of his college career with the Tigers.
