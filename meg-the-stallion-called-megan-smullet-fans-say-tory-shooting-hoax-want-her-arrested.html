Yesterday Tory Lanez lawyer released some EXPLOSIVE evidence, that could exonerate Tory Lanez in his shooting case against Megan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/mtonews.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MTg2MDIxNTIwNjAwOTk5NjE5/megnan_smullet.png><p>And ever since the evidence was leaked, MTO News has learned that social media has turned on Megan.</p><p>When Megan first spoke out about the shooting, and blamed Tory for it – social media was riding for the beautiful female rapper. Tory’s social media comments were flooded with negative messages, and fans boycotted all of his shows.</p><p>Yesterday was the first &nbsp;time since the incident first happened,<strong> that people began to TURN ON MEGAN.</strong></p><p>As MTO News has been reporting, Megan has been saying since the beginning – that Tory shot her. But with each day, as more evidence gets released, it seems more and more unlikely that happened. <strong>And social media smells blood in&nbsp;the water.</strong></p><p><strong>Atlanta Housewives Nene Drunk At Birthday Party . . . Goes TOO FAR w/ New Man!!</strong></p><p>Yesterday hundreds of people on Twitter began calling Megan The Stallion “Megan Smullet” – comparing her to actor Jussie Smollet, who was convicted of committing a “hoax” robbery in Chicago. Some are even calling for her to be “arrested” for false charges, if it turns out that Tory is innocent.</p><p>According to Tory’s lawyer Shawn Holley, police have located an independent witness – i.e. someone NOT connected to Tory Lanez, or Megan – who says they saw Meg fighting with her friend before the shooting. The same witness claims that the gunshot appeared to come from Meg’s friend and not Tory.</p><p>Shawn Holley also claims that Meg’s friend had gunshot residue on her hands.</p><p><strong>If everything that Shawn is saying is true, they might as well just drop the charges against Tory Lanez right now.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOppygZaSdsm6%2F05qjpaGfo3qkrculnJ1lnZq0orqMrKSupJyawW6ywKeqZquRrnq1u9GyZKygn6TBqrrGZp%2BomahixKK602afnqpdlr%2BzsdKtnJ1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
