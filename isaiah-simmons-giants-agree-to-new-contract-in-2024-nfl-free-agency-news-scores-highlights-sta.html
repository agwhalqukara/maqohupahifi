While he possessed the ability to play both linebacker and safety, he didn't truly stand out in either role.</p><p>In three seasons with the Cardinals, he recorded four interceptions and 7.5 sacks while racking up 13 tackles for loss. He appeared in 50 total games, starting in 37 of them.</p><p>While his time in Arizona ultimately didn't work out, he excelled in a smaller role with the Giants. Per <a href=# rel=noopener>Pro Football Reference</a>, Simmons played a career-low 33 percent of New York's defensive snaps.</p><p>However, he still accumulated 50 tackles and three passes defensed. He also picked up two tackles for loss. Simmons earned a commendable 68.9 grade from <a href=# rel=noopener>Pro Football Focus</a> for his efforts in 2023, the best mark of his career.</p><p>Simmons' lone interception was arguably his most impactful play of the season, picking off former Washington Commanders quarterback Sam Howell with less than 30 seconds remaining in a one-score game during Week 11.</p><p>He returned the interception for a game-sealing touchdown, giving the Giants their third victory of the season.</p>FOX Sports: NFL <span class=acct>@NFLonFOX</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>ISAIAH SIMMONS CALLED GAME.&lt;br>&lt;br>PICK SIX TO SEAL IT FOR THE GIANTS âœ…&lt;br>&lt;br>ðŸ“º: FOX &lt;a href="https://t.co/QTCeE0Wkae">pic.twitter.com/QTCeE0Wkae&lt;/a></p><p>Simmons will look to thrive under new defensive coordinator Shane Bowen during the safety's upcoming second season with the Giants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWqEdISMoqqaoZGderS1zKamp6tdnLaiutOsZJqfopqybsDOZqWer12YvK%2FA0ZqarWWZo3pzfJFtZKeenGKzs7HEZpignZ6Yxg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
