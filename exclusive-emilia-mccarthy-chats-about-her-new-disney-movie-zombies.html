That is until students from Zombietown integrate into the school and chaos erupts as human and zombie students struggle to coexist. It takes the courageous friendship between a fierce and determined cheerleader and zombie football star, Addison and Zed, to help unite their high school and ultimately their community.</p><p></p><p><strong>Hi Emilia thanks for answering a few of our questions, can you tell us a bit about your role in Zombies?</strong></p><p>My character Lacey is one of the human cheerleaders. She falls victim to society’s expectations in their town of Seabrook. But deep down she has an individuality that is wanting to come out, just like everyone else.</p><p><strong>What was the audition process like?</strong></p><p>I had an audition in Toronto and then for the callback we had to learn a dance routine to show the director and producers. They put us in different groups of Aceys (Lacey, Tracey, Stacey) and that’s how we were formed!</p><p><strong>Had you ever done any cheerleading before the movie?</strong></p><p>I did some cheerleading in High School but my main background was in dance and acting. So being able to act like a cheerleader and fake it was the easy part!</p><p><strong>Can you talk us through what the recording process was like to record the songs for the movie and how did you find it?</strong></p><p>We recorded the songs at a recording studio during the rehearsal period so that while filming we could use the real track with our voices. It was a very exciting process because so much went into it, that being able to listen to it and watch it was so interesting and even emotional.</p><p><strong>Who would you love to star in a movie with?</strong></p><p>I really love Michelle Williams and Charlize Theron. They’re such chameleons which I think is the ultimate goal as an actor. Although, literally everyone tells me I look like Amanda Seyfried so I wouldn’t be mad at playing her sister!</p><p><strong>You post regularly on Instagram, what type of accounts do you like following on there?</strong></p><p>I mostly follow my friends! But I also follow some celebrities and fashion accounts, as well as some interior design and cool homes accounts!</p><p><strong>What do you like to do when you’re not working?</strong></p><p>I like to have some fun times with my friends and I also like to hit the gym!&nbsp;<span class=im><br></span></p><span class=im><span class=im><br><strong>What would be your dream role?</strong></span></span>&nbsp;<p>My dream role would be a kick-butt type character. &nbsp;Like a&nbsp;<a href=#>Tomb Raider</a>&nbsp;vibe or even a Hit-Girl vibe from the movie Kick-Ass. I think it would be really cool to do your own stunts and look like a badass on screen!&nbsp;<span class=im><br></span></p><p><strong><span class=im>What can fans expect next from you?</span></strong></p><p>I was in a pilot that premiered in October that we’re waiting on to see if it will go to series. If it does, look out for Dark Haven High!</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Zombies airs on the Disney Channel in the US on Friday, Feb. 16 at 8/7c</strong></p><p><strong>Are you excited to see Zombies?
