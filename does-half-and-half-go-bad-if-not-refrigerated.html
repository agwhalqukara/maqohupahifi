If you left out half and half for more <b>than 2 hours, you should toss it. If it’s a hot (over 90 or 32) day, that period shrinks to an hour.

According to Cornell University, when a product is ultra-pasteurized, it’s heated to a minimum of 280 degrees Fahrenheit, and it stays at that temp for <b>at least two seconds</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_temperature_should_half-and-half_be_stored_at></span>What temperature should half-and-half be stored at?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>between 40 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happens_if_you_drink_spoiled_half_and_half></span>What happens if you drink spoiled half and half?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>However, even if you can get past the unpleasant taste, drinking spoiled milk isn’t a good idea.

A small sip of spoiled milk <b>is unlikely to cause symptoms beyond a bad taste.

Half and half can last around three to five days past its due date unopened, and seven to ten days after opening if you’re using a large container. The small cups of half and half last longer because they’ve been sterilized and sealed off; they can survive at least a month past the “best by” date.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_can_half_and_half_be_unrefrigerated></span>How long can half and half be unrefrigerated?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Half and half should be stored in a refrigerator like all dairy products such as buttermilk.

It’s best to store the dairy creamer in the refrigerator at 40-Degree Fahrenheit temperature.
