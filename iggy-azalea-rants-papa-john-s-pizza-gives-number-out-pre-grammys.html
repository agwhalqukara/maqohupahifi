All <strong>Iggy Azalea</strong> wanted before the 2015 Grammys was some scrumptious pizza, but all she got were some obnoxious tweets! The Australian rapper went on an epic rant about Papa John's Pizza after one of the chain restaurant's employees gave her personal phone number to their family members.</p><p>"@PapaJohns was my favorite pizza but the drivers they use give out your personal phone number to their family members," the "Fancy" star, 24, tweeted on Sunday, Feb. 8.</p><p>"And the supervisors at @PapaJohns refuse to send pictures of their employees so you can identify who it is that steals your information," she added. "You know, to protect their privacy…Too bad they don't value the privacy of their customers also. #DamnShame."</p><p><a href=#>@PapaJohns</a> I ordered a cheese pizza but instead I got tons of calls and messages like this one. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fgKhydivXb</a></p><p>— IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) <a href=#>February 8, 2015</a></p><p>Azalea even posted two text messages she received during the annoying exchange. One of the unidentified fans said their brother forwarded her number and hoped that she would write back because she's their "idol."</p><p>Azalea brushed it off after a bit, and tried to focus on the big night instead. "In other news: good luck to all tonight's nominees," she tweeted. "I'm super excited. Win or loose its been a great weekend. Goodluck @samsmithworld & @Sia."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The "Booty" entertainer was nominated for Record of the Year, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, Best Rap Album, and Best New Artist. She wore a royal blue custom-made Giorgio Armani silk crepe dress to the ceremony. After the show, she continued lashing out at the company when they wouldn't answer her questions.</p><p>"When an employee steals information it's called data breach. It's illegal. There are steps a corporation is supposed to follow afterward," she tweeted. "I want answers @papajohns why is customer confidentiality a joke to your company?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKCgn6lirruty56YZqqRo8G0ec%2Bap5plmqS1r7%2BMqaCzspFitKrCxKxkp62dl7Kzec6uq2aoopp6qL7ApqSyq11nfXKBl2s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
