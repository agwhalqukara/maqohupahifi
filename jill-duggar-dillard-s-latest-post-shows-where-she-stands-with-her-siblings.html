Over the weekend of August 12, Abbie celebrated her baby shower with a host of her sisters-in-law — including Jill Duggar Dillard.</p><p>Jill, who just welcomed her third baby in July, posted a new photo of herself with Abbie to her Instagram Stories. “Congrats @johnandabbie,”&nbsp;she wrote. “Loved getting to celebrate baby today!”</p><p>Another pic, posted by family friend Esther Bates, is a group shot of Abbie with Jana Duggar and Joy-Anna Duggar Forsyth, along with in-laws Katey, Kendra, and Lauren Duggar. All the women are wearing blue in an apparent nod to the new boy on the way. But Jill is missing, and the photo of her with Abbie shows her in a green shirt and flowered skirt.</p><p>Commenters wondered if this hinted at the status of Jill’s relationship with her family. “Why couldn’t they take pics together?” asked one. “Maybe Jill knew the guests were ‘invited to wear baby blues,’ but she chose not to do it,” replied another. A third guessed, “I doubt that Jill was involved in planning/throwing the shower, so there’s no reason for her to get the dress ‘memo.'”&nbsp;</p><p>Yet another took the high road. “Wearing blue or not, I’m sure she was happy to be there and was included. So happy for Jill.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toopmhuW6w1KCemqpdmbatuMCrm6xlnJbBpr%2FTZqeoq6RiwKm71qxksKCVp7Juv8eeZKyskaOxtHnWoquhZZiav26%2FyJujoqaXqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
