Poirier had Holloway in an armbar, which he escaped. Then Poirier had Holloway in a triangle and rolled him over and from there took his arm to end the fight.</p><p><strong>What we learned about Max Holloway:</strong></p><p>Holloway showed some promise in this fight. His UFC debut didn't go exactly as planned, but he has a lot to learn on the ground. His striking is pretty good, but again, it is the ground game that needs the work.</p><p><strong>What we learned about Dustin Poirier:</strong></p><p>No matter where this fight goes, Poirier is pretty dangerous. With this win it is his second straight victory by submission. Since moving down to featherweight, he is 4-0 and is on track to have a title shot sometime this year most likely.</p><p><strong>What's next for Holloway:</strong></p><p>Holloway will probably get a tune-up fight against a newcomer to the UFC. He is only 20 years old, so I'm sure the UFC will look to keep him under the promotion's banner and watch him progress.</p><p><strong>What's next for Poirier:</strong></p><p>Maybe a fight with recently defeated No. 1 contender Chad Mendes is in the future for Poirier. Poirier needs to get some names on his resume, so why not against Mendes?</p><p>Mendes' training partner, Danny Castillo, is still the only man to defeat Poirier.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_me-c.png alt="Follow SalDeRosea href=" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGltY21%2BeXnUn5pmaWRoerOx0q6jratdrLWiwIywnGaklZa%2Fr7HDZp2rp51isba%2F06KlZqifnr%2BqsdFmraxlnZbFbrTOpaOor5Gu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
