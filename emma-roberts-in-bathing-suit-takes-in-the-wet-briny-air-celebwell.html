"I cannot wake up without having my coffee and my me-time." She also loves to read. "Reading is my form of self-care and meditation," she maintains. "I set aside at least 20 minutes a day for it. Sometimes that turns into 30 minutes, an hour, two hours. There are so many books on my dining room table right now that I can't use it for eating. I go to the store and buy every book I want to read for the next few months and put them on the table."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/GettyImages-1404525123-1.jpg><p><span>Emma believes that getting enough sleep is more important for health than anything else. "I'm very easy on myself with diet and exercise. I want to be healthy, and I want to do a good job, but I never put pressure on myself because there are so many more important things, like sleep," she told the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>Zoe Report</span></a><span>. "To me, sleeping is more important than working out."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/GettyImages-1400666287.jpg><p><span>Emma told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>Shape</span></a><span> that she works out with a trainer, Andrea Orbeck, and does strength training. "Our sessions are an hour, focusing mostly on arms, abs, and ass-the all-important three A's," she says. Shealso likes to strike a pose. "I also do yoga. I usually take classes with a friend," she says. Another go-to workout of hers? "I love Pilates. I feel very energized and centered when I walk out the door afterward.I tried to get into running, but it didn't work for me. Pilates is something you take your time at, and it makes me feel very clear," she continued. Emma works out with Nonna Gleyzer at Body by Nonna. "I can see my shape transform within a couple of sessions," she maintains. "That's good because I'm that person who, after one class, lifts up her shirt and says, 'Where are my abs?' I want results!"</span></p><p><span>Emma listens to her body when it comes time to eat. "With my diet, I do what feels good for me at the time," Emma explained to Shape. "I try not to say that I won't eat something. Instead, I stay in tune with my body and my mind, and I think, What do I feel like eating?"&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/GettyImages-1396956617.jpg><p><span>Emma claims that a juice from Moon Juice, Spirit Dust, is "a fun way" to begin the morning. "I also drink iced coffee even when it's freezing outside because hot coffee doesn't wake me up," she added. Some days she will eat eggs, bacon, and toast for breakfast. "I adore classic breakfast foods," she says. "For lunch, I'll do a chopped salad with avocado, chicken, and tomatoes. Dinner is a turkey burger, or salmon with teriyaki or ponzu sauce, and brown rice with broccoli. I need snacks, particularly when I'm working. Lately I've become obsessed with seaweed. And chips and guacamole make me so happy!" What are her cheat foods? "I also love cupcakes, ice cream, and Sidecar Doughnuts. Sometimes I bring sweets for everyone at work as an excuse to eat them."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxknqWdlnqzu8Geqa2rXZ67bq7ArZ%2BippdiwLa102armqOVqHqquoytn55lp5rBbq7RoqWyZZGev3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
