Mindy Project Star Welcomes Daughter</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>A memorable Father’s Day, indeed! <strong>Ike Barinholtz</strong>, star of Fox’s Mindy Project, revealed on Twitter that his baby girl has made her arrival — posting a LOL picture of her spit up all over his shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>“My new daughter spitting up on me is my first father’s day gift and my favorite present ever,” he captioned the picture on Sunday, June 16.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The 36-year-old actor exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that he and his wife, <strong>Erica Hanson</strong>, were going to be first-time parents in April.&nbsp;</p><p>On June 6 at the Austin TV Festival, Barinholtz, who plays lovable nurse Morgan Tookers on the hit Fox show, explained how he was prepping for fatherhood.</p><p>“I am excited!” he said. “I’ve taken my childbirth preparation classes, I know what to put in the bag to take to the hospital, I have it all staked out. I’m all good! I’ve read a book, I’ve watched internet videos, I’ve got the Baby Center app, I’m good.”&nbsp;</p><p>He continued, “But with all that being said, when the time comes, I am going to forget it all, vomit, and possibly faint. It’s going to be pretty intense but I think I’m ready for it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the couple hasn’t shared their daughter’s name just yet, he joked that he and his wife have some pretty interesting contenders.</p><p>“My wife and I just started arguing about [baby names] recently, so we haven’t even had a top three,” he told Us in April. “Uh, Nicki Minaj Barinholtz, Carrie Underwood Barinholtz, Randy Jackson Barinholtz — and not Randy, the full name Randy Jackson. We do have name books, but they’re boring. Just literally a list of names.”</p><p>Before Mindy Project, Barinholtz was cast member from 2002-2007 on MADtv.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKCknV2XrrO1zaGmpayqYra0ecBmm5qcXWd9cn%2BQb20%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
