No changes were made to the image.</p><p>TOMORROW X TOGETHER (TXT) is one of the hottest 4th-gen K-pop idols, and the hype isn’t dying down anytime soon. The five-member boy group, consisting of Yeonjun, Soobin, Beomgyu, Taehyun, and Huening Kai, already started 2024 strong by bagging a <a href=#>People’s Choice Awards nomination</a> for The Group/Duo of the Year—attesting to their growing fame all over the world. With more eyes on the group, other artists and brands have been teaming up with TXT, leading to new collaborations under their belt and a packed 2024 ahead. Here’s a rundown of some of TXT’s most memorable collabs and who else they might partner with in the future:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Memorable collaborations</strong></h2><p>TXT has partnered with some of the hottest names in the music scene. Member Yeonjun joined forces with fellow K-pop idols and labelmates ENHYPEN for the song “Blockbuster,” performed at the 2022 Weverse concert. ENHYPEN debuted in 2020 and has been delighting fans with TXT interactions. They have also been gaining much traction for their partnerships with Pokémon and Prada.&nbsp;</p><p>On the second night of TXT’s Los Angeles concert for the ‘Act: Sweet Mirage’ world tour, rapper and singer Coi Leray surprised the crowd with a surprise performance of their collaboration “Happy Fools” from the group’s ‘The Name Chapter: Temptation’ mini album. Coi Leray is no stranger to big campaigns and collabs herself, having recently partnered with eyewear giant Ray-Ban for their new <a href=#>Ray-Ban sunglasses</a> equipped with Meta technology. The AI-enhanced smart glasses allow for high-quality photo taking, video recording, live streaming functions, and top-notch music, calls, and audio capabilities. While Coi Leray used the smart glasses to film herself at a tattoo studio this time around, she might be able to use them someday for onstage POV content to thrill fans the next time she performs with TXT. Still, the collab is notable for TXT, as being affiliated with a global star with many impressive endorsements underscores how their international renown is growing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Credit: @<a href=#>coileray</a> on Instagram</p><p>Another notable music collaboration for TXT was their single “Do It Like That” with <a href=#>boyband The Jonas Brothers</a>, which captured the attention of and united different generations of boyband fans. The JoBros have also had their brand-name collaborations, both individually and as a group. They teamed up with Marshemllo for Coca-Cola, and Joe Jonas was announced as the ambassador for fashion brand Scotch and Soda.</p><p>Aside from music, TXT also became the first group ambassadors for <a href=#>Dior luxury apparel</a>. The brand designed custom looks for their performance at the Lollapalooza music festival. They’ve also teamed up with personal care brand Kundal. The brand specializes in eco-friendly hair care products like shampoo, conditioner, and hair serums. Cosmetic brands like 4OIN FOREUL from Korea and Manyo Factory from Japan have also enlisted them as ambassadors.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to these partnerships, TXT has established itself as a global group, but there may be more to come. Here are some predictions about who the group will join forces with next:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>BTS</strong></h3><p>TXT is under the management of Big Hit Music, which is also responsible for massive K-pop superstars BTS. Despite being labelmates under HYBE and Big Hit, the two groups have not officially collaborated, whether for a song or performance. However, they’ve filmed many TikTok dance challenge videos for each other’s songs. A partnership may be more difficult as many BTS members currently serve in the Korean military. But with eldest member Jin’s discharge in mid-2024, the potential for a partnership isn’t impossible, especially with many fans patiently waiting for them to team up.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bebe Rexha</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Credit: @<a href=#>beberexha</a> on Instagram</p><p>TXT leader Soobin is a massive fan of <a href=#>singer Bebe Rexha</a>, who has shown a lot of love for him and the rest of the group. As early as 2019, she said she’d love to collaborate with the group. She’s already met Soobin, so a great relationship between her and TXT can be the foundation for an official partnership. Another potential basis is that Bebe Rexha has previously dipped her toes into the K-pop scene, having made the demo for K-pop legends SHINee’s 2010 hit “Lucifer” when she was 17 years old!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Burberry</strong></h3><p>More fashion brand collaborations may be in the cards for TXT. Fans have been speculating a partnership with Burberry, in particular. Yeonjun was seen attending one of the brand’s events in 2022 and posted many sponsored posts for the brand on his Instagram. He’s also been spotted wearing the brand’s apparel on multiple occasions.&nbsp;Since Big Hit is known to push for group endorsement for their male idols, the rest of the TXT members may also be seeing a Burberry collab in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kxKm7jLCgpaRdoHqxu89mmaixXZy%2FsMHPZquxrF2YvK24wJtksKGknXqvsdetZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
