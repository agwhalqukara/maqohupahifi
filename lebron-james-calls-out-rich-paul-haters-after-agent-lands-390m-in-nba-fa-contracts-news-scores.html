But FACTS 🤷🏾‍♂️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/s5xlggEfnp">https://t.co/s5xlggEfnp&lt;/a></p><p>James and Paul have a long-standing relationship dating back to the early 2000s while Paul worked under Leon Rose—who represented James for a bit—at Creative Artists Agency (CAA). After several years at the agency, Paul left and formed Klutch taking James with him and forming a sports business empire.</p><p>Not a bad deal having arguably the best player of all-time in your corner as the duo seem to have pretty unbreakable bond.</p><p>In addition to making all of his clients richer, Paul is also taking home a pretty penny as he's earning up to four percent of every contract. So, all around a pretty great start to the offseason for him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGaAc4OMpZybqp%2BjequtzJ6qZpuRobm0ec6uq2aqmZi1brzArqNmoJGpsrO%2FjJqdrZ2iYq6osc2tZKWZnpnAbn%2BYaaRmoZ5iu6OtjJ%2BYZpufo8GzrcKtqg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
