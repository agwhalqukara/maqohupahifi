The Byrd and the Bees actor — who has struggled with substance abuse for years — opened up about a “minor relapse” he recently had via Instagram on Tuesday, May 26.</p><p>To share the news, Meyers posted a heartfelt message on his fiancee <strong>Mara Lane’s </strong>account. “Mara and I are thankful for your support and kindness during this time. I apologize for having a minor relapse and hope that people don’t think too badly of me,” the 37-year-old captioned a photo of the actress, who <a href=#>appears to be crying.</a> “I stopped drinking immediately and it is no reflection on Damascus Cover as I was not meant to attend Cannes this year and I apologize to fans and colleagues.”</p><p>Earlier this month, the Irish actor was photographed drinking straight out of a vodka bottle while walking down a London street. He looked disoriented, tired, and disheveled, and had stains on his shirt.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I am on the mend and thank well wishers and sorry for my disheveled appearance as I was on my way home from a friends and had not changed,” he continued via Instagram. “I feel I made a mistake and feel quite embarrassed but this was just a blip in my recovery otherwise I’m living a healthy life. Love and blessings. #Rebel #Angel.”</p><p>Meyers was hospitalized back in June 2011 for relapsing, and has been arrested for public intoxication on several occasions. In November 2013, <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> claimed that NBC withheld his Dracula salary until he completed filming to make sure his substance abuse didn’t get in the way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGoppGptaK6jKufsqtdorK6sdGsZKGZlGK6qrrOq2SrnZyWvbSxjKyrqKigmrFusNGipaShnpx6qrnMnpuimaSaubp5kWlobmpmag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
