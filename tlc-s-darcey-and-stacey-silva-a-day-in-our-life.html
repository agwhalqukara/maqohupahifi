She initially thought she had <a href=#>found her person in <strong>Jesse Meester</strong> and then in <strong>Tom Brooks</strong></a>, but neither relationship worked out. After dealing with a double dose of heartbreak, she landed her own show, <a href=#>Darcey & Stacey</a>, with her sister.</p><p>Prior to the series premiere, the siblings opened up about sharing their journey with the world. “I feel like everybody’s going to get a sense of who we are as individuals — not only as twins, but as individuals, <a href=#>as Darcey and Stacey</a>, but also our family,” Darcey exclusively told Us Weekly in August 2020.</p><p>In terms of romance, Darcey moved on and began dating <strong>Georgi Rusev</strong> after meeting him online and later in person in Miami during the Super Bowl in 2020. “He has a lot of great energy. His demeanor’s really fun. We had a lot of fieriness with us and he’s Bulgarian. He’s from there originally, but he lives in the States. … It’s been a really fun, exciting relationship and exciting to see where it goes.”</p><p>The couple <a href=#>announced their engagement</a> in October 2020 after keeping the proposal a secret since that June. (Darcey has two teenage daughters, Aniko and Aspen, from a previous marriage.)</p><p>Stacey, for her part, also let fans in on her love life with husband <strong>Florian Sukaj</strong>. The pair met online and he popped the question soon after. They tied the knot in April 2020.</p><p>“We had a long engagement and it was a pretty healthy relationship and we both wanted it to work,” she told Us, noting that <a href=#>there was “some drama that has happened” since then</a>. “It’s hard to talk about, but you know, it’s a part of it, and I lived it and I’m just trying to focus on the moment. I’m just blessed to have Darcey by my side to be there to support me.”</p><p>Darcey and Stacey may be known for their reality TV relationships, but the duo stay plenty busy with their fashion brand, House of Eleven, and their family too.</p><p>Want to see the Silva sisters’ day in action?
