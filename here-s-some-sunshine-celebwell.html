Jenkins, 25, is on a sun-soaked vacation in an exotic, far-flung location, sharing pictures of herself posing by a luxury pool wearing a white one-piece cutout swimsuit. "Here's some sunshine ðŸŒž," she captioned the post. How does she stay so fit?</span> <span>Read on to see 5 ways </span><span>Jenkins</span><span> stays in shape and the photos that prove they work.</span></p><p><span>Jenkins loves working out in the fresh air, and took full advantage of all the beautiful hiking trails on a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>recent trip to Los Angeles</span></a><span>. "Hiking is cardiovascular in nature, so it can provide great benefit to heart health while also improving blood pressure and blood sugar levels," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Jen Kates</span></a><span>, Pn2, NASM-CPT, ACE Certified Health Coach. "Hiking helps increase the strength in the leg muscles, builds stability in the core muscles and enhances balance skills. The more technical the terrain is, along with an increase in climbing intensity, the more balance and core strength is required because more muscles are being recruited to manage the steeper terrain."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1252194217.jpg><p><span>Jenkins loves swimming, and is confident in both a regular pool and the ocean. Aside from being fun, swimming is a great joint-friendly low-impact way to get exercise. "As a low-impact activity, swimming places minimal stress on the joints," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Sarah Ellison</span></a><span>, aquatic physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Network. "The buoyancy of the water allows you to move limbs and joints more easily through their normal range of motion. This helps joints remain supple and improves overall flexibility."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1488903594.jpg><p><span>Jenkins loves a plate of fresh fruit for breakfast, especially if she's enjoying her meal </span><i><span>al fresco</span></i><span>. "Certain fruits are also high in flavonoids," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Teresa Fung, MS, RD, ScD</span></a><span>. "This is a diverse group of compounds, some of which are potent antioxidants that protect against oxidative damage, and may reduce the risk of certain diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In particular, citrus fruits are high in the flavanones class of flavonoids, and blackberries, blueberries, cranberries, and cherries are high in the anthocyanidins class of flavonoids."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/Lana-Jenkins.png><p><span>Jenkins enjoys yoga sessions, and </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>even tried goat yoga</span></a><span> when she was in Los Angeles. "Even at this early stage of research, a regular yoga practice appears to correlate with increased wellbeing, including better sleep, better body awareness, weight loss, and greater happiness," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>say the experts at Harvard Health</span></a><span>. "By improving mindfulness, it simultaneously helps to boost compassion, gratitude, and 'flow' states, all of which contribute to greater happiness."</span></p><p><span>Jenkins speaks fluent Spanish thanks to a childhood spent in Spain. Research shows being bilingual is highly beneficial for brain health. "In addition to staving off the decline that often comes with aging, bilingualism can also protect against illnesses that hasten this decline, like Alzheimer's disease. In a study of more than 200 bilingual and monolingual patients with Alzheimer's disease, bilingual patients reported showing initial symptoms of the disease at about 77.7 years of ageâ€”5.1 years later than the monolingual average of 72.6," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>say Viorica Marian, PhD, and Anthony Shook</span></a><span>.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpZmelnqrsc2koKerXZ67br%2FWoqSsrZmperSt2KxkoZ2imsBuv86mnGarpaPAqbXNnmSipl2jsrh5z6Gmradf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
