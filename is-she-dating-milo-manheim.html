Many are looking forward to their next projects and hoping to work with them more frequently in the future. J-14 contacted both actors' agents for comments, but neither one responded right away.</p><p>The relationship, however, is only based on rumors. They are working together, which is rather confusing for their relationship. Therefore, it's also feasible that they are just close friends who get along well. Together, they make a cute couple.

Asher Dov Angel and Peyton Elizabeth Lee, a.k.a. Jonah Beck and Andi Mack, have such a genuine connection, as everyone who follows <a href=# rel=noopener>Andi Mack</a> will attest. What began as Andi's major crush in Season 1 completely turned into an emotional rollercoaster for the two of them. There were many ups and downs, from Andi learning their friendship wasn't as strong as she thought it was to Jonah getting a high school girlfriend. When J-14 spoke with Asher, he told us that, in reality, he and Peyton are just as close as you might think.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/04/peyton-elizabeth-lee-boyfriend-2023-asher-angel.jpg alt="Peyton Elizabeth Lee with her rumored boyfriend, co-star Asher Angel." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Peyton Elizabeth Lee with her rumored boyfriend, co-star Asher Angel.<br></strong><strong>Image Source: Celeb Mafia</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The cast as a whole is quite tight. Though they are all in love with one another, they are not dating. Fans want to think that Andi and Jonah's on-screen crushes are also real, but regrettably, TV relationships only exist on the screen. However, one of the loveliest scenes involving the friends was when Asher performed Being Around You&nbsp;for Peyton at one of his concerts. This is the same song that Jonah performed for Andi in the show.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, they came out only as friends and nothing more. So there you go; they resemble friends more than they do a boyfriend and a girlfriend. Although Peyton Elizabeth Lee is single now, she will for sure find someone in the coming days, and we hope to share the news with you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGinnrGkpLtuscuisZqalam1brjEnmSbp6mbv6qxzZ1ka2hiaHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
