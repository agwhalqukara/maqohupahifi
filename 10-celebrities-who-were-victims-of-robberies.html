Every time you turn on the TV there’s a new story about something crazy happening in the world, and unfortunately it seems like no one is safe. Although people in nice neighborhoods often think they’re immune, sometimes they’re the ones that get hit the hardest. Even celebrities, with all of their money, can’t even afford to keep themselves out of harm’s way. With their big homes&nbsp;and valuable possessions, they often become targets for those looking for a quick come up. Celebrities having their houses broken into by criminals and/or over zealous fans has become a serious problem. You’d think they’d have better security systems, but apparently that isn’t always the case. Here are 10 celebrities who were victims of robberies.</p><p><strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/456392264.jpg alt='LONDON, ENGLAND - SEPTEMBER 30: Lindsay Lohan attends a photocall for "Speed The Plow" at Playhouse Theatre on September 30, 2014 in London, England.

The group, who broke in during an unlocked door in the middle of the day, got away with several of Lohan’s items including paintings, a fur coat, two Hermes bags, and a Chanel necklace. Lohan called the police when she returned home to find out that it had been broken into.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Tim P.

However, the people who broke into Kate Moss’ house had other plans. While Moss was sleeping,&nbsp;robbers broke into her home, and&nbsp;stole $140,000 worth of art including a&nbsp;portrait by Banksy. Ironically, a local art gallery was also robbed of their Banksy paintings just a few days later.</p><p>(Photo by Dave M.

In August 2014, Sarandon’s New York home was broken into while she was out of town. The thieves were able to make off with several of Sarandon’s belongings including jewelry, a camera, and a laptop.</p><p>(Photo by Ben Gabbe/Getty Images for TIME)</p><p><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/467225712.jpg alt="Miley Cyrus Appearance At Omnia Nightclub At Caesars Palace" width=638 height=498 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Miley Cyrus is one of the most popular young artists in the music industry, which makes her a huge target for all sorts of things. Cyrus was robbed in the summer of 2014 when her California home was broken into by a man and a woman who climbed a fence and entered the house through the garage. Not only did the pair steal some of Cyrus’ jewelry, but they also made off with her new Maserati. Unfortunately, that incident was the second time that Cyrus’ home was broken into within a period of less than a year.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Queen Latifah</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/475425172.jpg alt="5th Annual Critics' Choice Television Awards - Arrivals" width=640 height=474 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sadly, Queen Latifah is no stranger to having her possessions stolen. In 1995, at the height of her rap career, Latifah made headlines when her BMW was stolen in New York by two teenagers who were carrying guns. In 2008, Latifah’s vacation home in Trinidad was broken into and $10,000 worth of jewelry was stolen.&nbsp;Local authorities said that they believed the crime was committed by members of the housekeeping/grounds staff who were supposed to be watching over the property.</p><p>(Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Megan Fox</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/88498416.jpg alt width=641 height=411 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Megan Fox is yet another celebrity who unfortunately fell victim to the “Bling Ring.” While still dating her soon to be ex-husband, Brian Austin Green, the couple’s home was broken into and several of their belongings including items from Fox’s closet. Apparently, Bling Ring leader, Rachel Lee, was a huge fan of Fox’s wardrobe and decided to take some of her clothing.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Usher</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/460584910.jpg alt="Usher And Ben Haenow Visit Kiss" width=641 height=420 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The holiday season is usually a pretty big time for robberies. In fact, over the years, there have been several reports of people waiting&nbsp;in parking lots and breaking into shoppers cars when they leave items behind to continue shopping. In 2010, Usher fell victim to one of these type of robberies when his car was broken into while he and a friend were in the AT&T store. Apparently, robbers forced their way into the car and stole everything in sight including thousands of dollars worth of gift cards and $50,000 in furs.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Keri Russell</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/454647310.jpg alt="Altuzarra for Target Launch Event" width=639 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In December 2013, Keri Russell’s Brooklyn home was broken into while she was in bed sleeping. Fortunately, Russell was not hurt, and she was able to call the police. However, the intruders were able to get away with some of her jewelry before they were caught at a neighbor’s house trying to do the same thing.</p><p>(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Target)</p><p><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/493092123.jpg alt width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Paris Hilton was the first celebrity to be robbed by the “Bling Ring” back in 2008. &nbsp;Apparently, the group chose her because they saw her as “dumb” and thought her house would be easy to break into. Well, as you probably already know, the group was right – and they were able to successfully break into Paris’ home several times. In fact, Hilton didn’t even realize any of her possessions had been stolen until the group made out with nearly $2 million worth of jewelry. In 2013, Hilton found herself being robbed again by a group of girls who stole items from her bedroom while Hilton was hanging out with some of her friends.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Chris Brown</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/475335568.jpg alt="The iHeartRadio Summer Pool Party - Show" width=638 height=452 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Once you reach a certain level of fame, it’s hard to know who you can trust – and Chris Brown learned this lesson the hard way. Just a few months ago, Brown’s house was broken into and robbed and his aunt was held at gun point and locked in a closet. The thieves, who were later revealed to be close friends of Brown’s, stole $50,000 in cash they knew he had recently made from a performance.</p><p>(Getty Images)</p><p>Lead&nbsp;(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2LDqq%2FToqSsZaKkr6Ox0aKcrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
