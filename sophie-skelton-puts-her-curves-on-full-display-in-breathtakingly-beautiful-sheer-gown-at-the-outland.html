Wearing Georges Hobeika Spring/Summer 2020 Couture, the 25-year-old beauty was stunning in the sheer gown. The dress’ bodice is made of intricately braided tulle that gives the dress a nearly woven effect. Free-flowing panels of tulle flow from the shoulders and dress’ skirt that features high slits on both sides. From the front view, you can’t completely see that this dress is revealing, but it is. With the sheer paneling and the high slits, Sophie’s long legs and curves were on full display.</p><p>You may see a photo of the dress as shared on the official Georges Hobeika Instagram site where two models are wearing both tulle dresses. If you look closely to the bodice, you can see that the dress is actually composed of braided tulle making this a very unique and original look.</p><p>The pastel colors of lilac, aqua, and lemon-yellow give this dress a dream-like feel and it’s no wonder people are comparing Sophie to a fairytale princess and goddess.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7lrR6-gMpW/</p><p>Though the model to the right, in the photo above, shows a bit of skin with the cut-out waist and sheer paneling you can’t clearly see that Sophie’s dress is sheer or see-through. Additionally, layers of dreamy tulle flow behind making a train giving the feeling that she is fully covered; however, this is not the case.</p><p>You may see two photos in the slideshow below showing Sophie on the red carpet in the gorgeous Georges Hobeika Haute Couture gown below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8ikA1vhVH2/</p><p>You may see a side-by-side comparison of Sophie Skelton wearing the dress and a runway model who walked the Hobeika show in the same gown in the photo player below. With the model, you can see the high slits on both sides that Sophie has covered for her photo.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8jPUlcFRLX/</p><p>Don’t be fooled, as this dress is very revealing. Here is another photo of Sophie on the red carpet, and with this side view, you get a better picture of how exposed Sophie truly was. Check out the pictures in the photo slideshow below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8iCucFBNH1/</p><p>What do you think about the Georges Hobeika braided tulle Haute Coutre dress?</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you think the dress is too revealing or do you like it?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejpL2ptcRmqqSdnKm8r3nPrqusZZiav26v1KutnqtdpLtustSlo2acmai9ra3YZqCnZZKnsqLAx62YpKGenLm6ecGemK6smZvCrXnSoZyeql2cvLi6jJqrZqyYmnqwwdOlmKeclad6sb7EpqCeqpVigHeFkWxtaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
