Years before, she’d worked as a dancer during her teenage years at “King Of Diamonds”, a strip club in Miami. According to VH1, the star got into exotic dancing as a way to provide for her son.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-483294 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51803954_248238719395593_4929059329237094912_n-600x600.jpg alt="Miami Tip" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-483294 class=wp-caption-text>Kenisha “Miami Tip Drill” Myree. (Photo: @miamitip305/Instagram)</p><p>Part of the “LHHMIA” star’s adult act included her climbing 30-foot ceilings and fearlessly sliding all the way down. On Feb. 18, 2012, she attempted one of her signature stripper moves and fell from a 35-foot pole. Her injuries were so severe that she lost a kidney and had the entire left side of her face reconstructed. She took a two-year hiatus from exotic dancing, but eventually made her way back to the pole.</p><p>During a deleted scene of episode 8 of “LHHMIA,” Myree explained to her longtime friend <a href=#><strong>Bobby Lytes</strong></a> while recounting the accident that her nearly fatal accident was a wake-up call.</p><p>“I wasn’t even on the pole I was on the beams on top of the pole,” the 32-year-old explained to Lytes. “I’m swinging back and forth and going back to catch myself on the pole I must’ve miscalculated my step … and I missed the pole and fell.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-483310 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mia.png alt="Love and Hip Hop: Miami" width=590 height=336 sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-483310 class=wp-caption-text>Bobby Lytes and Kenisha “Miami Tip Drill” Myree. (Photo: @loveandhiphop/Instagram)</p><p>Myree said the only thing that saved her from landing straight on the floor after falling was bouncing off a customer onto the floor.</p><p>“It was still a hard fall to where my left eye was down, I lost a kidney… And I was five minutes from dying. I broke my jaw and I had to have that wired,” she said. “It was a blessing in disguise.”</p><p>However, “Love and Hip Hop: Miami” viewers didn’t buy what they deemed Myree’s “sympathy story” and slammed her continuing her career as a stripper despite her almost fatal accident.</p><p>“And you are still dancing,” one viewer wrote. “I’m sorry but some people just never learn their lesson 🤦🏻‍♀️.”</p><p>“Yea that was tragic, but why is Tip still stripping? That’s stupid if you ask me&nbsp;🤷🏻‍,” another added.</p><p>One Twitter user wrote,” I wanna feel bad for sis sympathy story but she still doing the same thing dat almost got her kilt 😞.”</p><p>Several fans, on the other hand, commended Myree for telling her story.</p><p>“This was so brave of you❤️ .&nbsp;We almost lost you. I’ll never forget where I was and the moment I heard it . Devastating.”</p><p>The 32-year-old did <a href=# rel=noopener>tell</a> fans that the incident changed her life for the better and said it inspired her to do music.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Are you enjoying gettin' to know @miamitip305 more this season?
