Nah. Let’s not start any weird rumors,” she <a href=#>said</a>. “No no, that’s my pocket. It’s fluffy on the inside so it’s giving a little bump. Stop. Don’t even start!”</p><p>Rumors also circulated that Remy cheated on her husband, Shamele “Papoose” Mackie, with battler rapper <a href=#>Eazy The Block Captain</a>. Remy and the “Favors” rapper have been spotted together on numerous occasions since June and many seem to believe they are more than friends.</p><p>The duo have been spotted eating together at <a href=#>Red Lobster</a> and standing too closely at an event for Remy’s Chrome 23 Battle Rap Tournament.</p><p><a href=#>Watch the Full Video Here.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>More fuel was added to the fire following reports Papoose allegedly punched the Philadelphia rapper for getting “too cozy” with Remy Ma.&nbsp;However, Remy denied the fight took place in a post on X.</p><p>“I’d like to apologize to everyone that was disappointed tonight because we couldn’t get 3 full rounds from all the opponents,” she <a href=#>wrote</a> on June 17. “I tried …and can y’all pleasee STOP with the Eazy & Pap LIES There’s NO place like Chrome! Right back at it ; see y’all in August. #Chrome23.”</p><p>However, a fan recently recorded Remy and Eazy at an Eagles-Cowboys football game on Nov. 5 in a video shared on X. On Nov. 10, Remy shared a <a href=#>video</a> featuring a few moments of her wearing a white tank top, a purple skirt, and silver boots.</p><p>Two commenters said, “Single women behavior aka thirst trappin lol” and “I still love you but you did my man wrong y’all created black love.”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Remy Ma (@remyma)</a></p><p>Social media users say this is proof that the couple who have been together for nearly two decades were falling apart.</p><p>Remy hasn’t shared a post of or with her husband Papoose since sharing a Happy Birthday post to him on March 6.
